  <h1>Multilingualism - Language awareness</h1>
  <p>Multilingualism is the use of two or more languages by an individual speaker or a community. Language acquisition is the process by which humans acquire the capacity to perceive and understand language, as well as to produce words and sentences to communicate. Language acquisition usually refers to first language acquisition, which studies infants' acquisition of their native language.</p>
  <p><b>How do we know if multilingual students are faster than monolingual students?</b></p>
  <p>Study which supports that multilingual people are faster than monolingual people as they’re brains process information faster. Also this study explains how monolingual peoples’ brains had to work harder than the brain of multilingual people (Shute, 2013). This study was made by Brian Gold, a neuroscientist at the University Of Kentucky College Of Medicine in Lexington. The study was of older people who grew up bilingual, who did an attention-switching task, a skill that typically fades with age. He compared the multilingual seniors with monolingual seniors, and found that monolingual seniors’ brains were working harder to complete the task than the ones of multilingual people. There are arguments which support that multilingual people are faster at doing certain tasks than monolingual people, and that in these situations the monolingual people brains had to work harder than the ones from multilingual people. One of the studies also said that people who speak multiple languages make the best employees (Hogan-Brun, 2017). This is because multilingual people have multicultural awareness as they come from different backgrounds and, because the structure of a language we speak changes and influences the way we see the world around us. Therefore, speakers of different languages display different mental models and different semantic associations. And they come up with different solutions and ideas making the company prosper. This connects to neuroscience, as by learning a new language our neurons are changing and our brain makes new ones to replace the old ones, so that we can store more information.
The counter arguments:
There is an article which talks about brain plasticity and, explains what it is. Basically brain plasticity is the process by which our brains can change and create new neural pathways by learning from experience (Alban). Therefore if we increase our brain plasticity it will, in theory make us faster, and it’s not only by learning a new language that we can increase our brain plasticity. We can also increase it by playing sports, like yoga or meditation. Also brain plasticity can make us smarter meaning that monolingual people who do a lot of brain training to develop more brain plasticity can be smarter than multilingual people.</p>
